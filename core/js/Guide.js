// Please note:

// * This code is designed to be readable but for compactness it only includes brief comments. You can see fuller comments
//   in the project Subversion repository at http://svn.tiddlywiki.org/Trunk/core/
//
// * You should never need to modify this source code directly. TiddlyWiki is carefully designed to allow deep customisation
//   without changing the core code. Please consult the development group at http://groups.google.com/group/TiddlyWikiDev
